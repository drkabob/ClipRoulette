ClipRoulette is an awesome way to get a taste of the strange reaches of YouTube you would have never found yourself.

It works by picking a random YouTube video and creating a small clip (up to 10 seconds) out of that video.

So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the videos you never would have watched otherwise!
